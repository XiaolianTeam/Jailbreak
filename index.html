<h1>孝廉</h1>
<b><p style="margin-top: -30px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;">for iOS 11.0 - 11.2.6</p></b>

<b>孝廉</b> (孝廉) Jailbreak is an iOS 11.2+ jailbreak for all arm64 devices.
Our team is made up of new deccelopers and was only recently made.
We were hoping that jailbreaking will be an interesting area to explore.

<b>This jailbreak does not include Cydia</b>

<b>Notes</b>
Make sure to always check shasum!
After you jailbreak 孝廉, you will get a root shell. This can be utilised very easily, through Netcat.
If you remove any files through ssh, you cannot expect us to support you with your broken device it was your own fault.
This version does not require a developer account thanks to the vfs exploit.

<b>Disclaimer</b>
Please make a backup through iTunes, even if <b>孝廉</b> has been tested on several devices by our team.
The final beta was built 2018-06-25, and has been running successfully since then.

<b>Q&A</b>
<b>Use this or wait for Electra?</b>
<b>孝廉</b> Jailbreak has less functionality than Electra, or any full jailbreak.
It does not include Cydia. Although, it is still a jailbreak and can also be run alongside Electra no problem.

<b>Do you need a developer account?</b>
No. We have seen that empty_list has an improved success rate now, on most devices, although multi_path still works better.
We can guarantee support on all devices with both exploits.

<b>Will this tool support iOS 11.3.x?</b>
Yes, very soon. However, our remount patch seems to be broken on a few devices.
When we solve that issue, <b>孝廉</b> Jailbreak will be updated immediately.

<b>Will it save a snapshot so we can remove the jailbreak?</b>
No. APFS has a bug which makes our remount patch unusable after a restore.

<b>Finally</b>
ENJOY the jailbreak! Make sure to follow us on Twitter for the latest updates!
